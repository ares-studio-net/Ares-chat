## presentation
Ares Chat is a straightforward chat management plugin. Its primary (for now) function is to filter out curse words from your chat, providing a less toxic environment for your players. It draws inspiration from the Rinaorc Chat Block plugin.

Setting it up is a breeze, and it uses minimal computing power, making it suitable for both small and large servers.

## wiki

Even though the plugin is extremely easy to set up, here's a brief guide on configuring the config.yml
- Copy and paste the original config.yml.
- Change the ID (which is initially set to 0).
- And voilà!


Example:

```yml
blocked:
  0:
    word: "ez"
    replace: "blocked by Ares Chat"
  1:
    word: "duck"
    replace: "blocked by Ares Chat"
  2:
    word: "curse_word_1"
    replace: "blocked by Ares Chat"
  3:
    word: "curse_word_2"
    replace: "blocked by Ares Chat"
  # Continue adding more words and replacements as needed
```
